# AmazonAutomationFramework:

I have worked under many different automation projects for the past 9 years. And in most of them, I have to redo the same job, like customising wait times, reduce the flakiness of the test suites. Sometimes I have to build the framework from scratch. This has become boring. So I would like to build an Open Source framework, that will include all the things that I have learned so far in my career.

Actually I am actively applying for Product Based companies like Amazon, PayPal and I would like to impress them by showing off this framework ;). Hope this succeeds. I hope to complete this framework within two weeks since I don't have a lot of time with me right now.

This automation framework will include support for UI/Web Automation, Mobile Automation and Rest API Automation.

Cheers,
Kishore M
